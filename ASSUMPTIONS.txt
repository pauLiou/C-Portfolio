For the purposes of this code I have made the following assumptions:

1. That rovers can occupy the same space.
2. That instructions were worth implementing (with a degree of sanitisation).
3. That a rover will obey instructions even if that results in it being destroyed.

To run the code:

Open it in your IDE and build it to generate .exe or just compile and run the code in release mode.
